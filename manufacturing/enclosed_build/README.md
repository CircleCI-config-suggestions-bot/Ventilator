# Enclosed build

## DISCLAIMER

**This is an incomplete, as yet untested design that is not yet intended to be used on patients.**

This page contains a running list of notes and planned updates that will be organized and added to as we get further into beta design and build.

## Concept

These components are intended to be assembled into a rugged sheet metal enclosure for the final mechanical design. The
compact version of the ventilator assembly and packaging strategy has already gone through several iterations,
including an Alpha Build device which proved out the use of a detachable internal structure for ease of assembly.

The next iteration of this build will demonstrate the packaging in the production housing, which has been designed but
not yet constructed. Based on lessons learned from the Alpha Build prototyping process, the ventilator will use a
detachable internal assembly, to which all pneumatic components can be mounted and connected. This allows for 360
degree accessibility to components during initial assembly. When complete, this internal assembly is bolted into the
enclosure, and the enclosure is screwed shut. The top-rear positioning of the removable enclosure lid provides
access to components that will need routine maintenance.

## India build

Preliminary enclosed build was produced by our partners, Foundry-M in Visakhapatnam, India.
